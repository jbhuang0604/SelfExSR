QPBO, version 1.1.

Changes from version 1.0:
- fixed a bug in Probe(). (Thanks to Tian Taipeng for noticing that there is a bug).

  Details: In version 1.1 the transformed energy after calling Probe() was incorrect.
   As a result, the option ProbeOptions::weak_persistencies=1 was not working correctly,
   since it called the main probing function iteratively.

- Added new function Improve() (without arguments), which generates a random permutation itself.
